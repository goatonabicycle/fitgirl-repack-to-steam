# FitGirl Steam Lookup

Adds Steam links with prices, review scores, and other useful info directly to FitGirl Repacks game listings.

## Maybe this one is worth buying?

This is an extension that simply connects the lovely games you might see on a certain website to that same game on Steam.

Fitgirl repacks is a great source for finding new releases or see updated games. If you find yourself constantly copy and pasting the title to see the game's price and reviews on Steam, because you might want to just buy it, this extension should save you some time.

This extension is not meant to encourage or discourage any piracy related behaviour. It's simply linking two worlds together to make your life a little simpler.
